## About Me  

 Technical writer with two years of experience collaborating with SMEs and analyzing applications to create user-friendly documentation. After a 12-year parental leave, I updated my skills by learning the latest technical writing tools and processes for developing technical documents. I am passionate about improving user experience through well-organized documentation and simplifying complex technical concepts.
